**Description:** This lecture continues with open problems involving general unfoldings of polyhedra and proof of vertex unfolding using construction of facet-paths. Approaches for unfolding orthogonal polyhedra, grid unfolding, and folding convex polyhedra are presented.

**Speaker:** Erik Demaine
